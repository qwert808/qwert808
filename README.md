## About Me

I am a dedicated Computer Science student with a strong focus on **Full-Stack Development** and a passion for **Artificial Intelligence**. My expertise lies in building complete, end-to-end applications — from developing robust backend services using **C#** and **.NET Core**, to creating seamless mobile experiences with **React Native**.

I enjoy bridging the gap between application development and machine learning. I use **Python** to integrate intelligent, data-driven features into the software I create.

To enhance my expertise, I’m actively exploring:
- Advanced deep learning with **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch**
- Deployment and model lifecycle best practices through **MLOps**

I also build **React-based web applications**, and enjoy working on scalable, production-ready systems using tools like **TailwindCSS** for responsive and clean UI design.
